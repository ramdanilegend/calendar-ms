		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Database Schema Implementation task into subtasks covering: 1) Environment setup and connection configuration, 2) Core tables and TypeScript interfaces creation, 3) Constraints and indexes implementation, and 4) Migration scripts development. Include specific deliverables and acceptance criteria for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up multiple database tables with TypeScript interfaces, constraints, and indexes. It requires technical knowledge of PostgreSQL and Sequelize ORM. The complexity comes from ensuring proper relationships between tables and implementing the correct constraints. Breaking it into setup, core implementation, constraints, and migration components makes it more manageable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Repository Layer Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Repository Layer Implementation task into subtasks covering: 1) Base repository interface and common utilities, 2) Calendar repository implementation, 3) Translation repository implementation, 4) Update metadata repository implementation, and 5) Transaction and error handling utilities. For each subtask, specify the methods to implement and their signatures.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing multiple repository classes with TypeScript interfaces, complex database queries, transaction support, and error handling. It's more complex than the schema implementation as it involves business logic and query optimization. Dividing by repository type plus shared utilities creates logical separation of concerns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Google Calendar Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the Google Calendar Integration task into subtasks covering: 1) Authentication and API client setup, 2) Calendar data fetching for different calendar types, 3) Rate limiting and batch processing implementation, 4) Data transformation and storage integration, and 5) Scheduler implementation for annual fetches. Include error handling requirements for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves external API integration with authentication, rate limiting, retry logic, and scheduled execution. It requires handling multiple calendar types and transforming the data for storage. The complexity is high due to external dependencies, potential API failures, and the need for robust error handling and scheduling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Calendar Conversion Service",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Calendar Conversion Service task into subtasks covering: 1) Core conversion utilities for Gregorian to Hijri dates, 2) Indonesia's rukyat-based calendar handling, 3) Regional mapping application and fallback logic, and 4) Validation and utility functions. Include test cases for each conversion scenario.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex date conversion logic between different calendar systems, including region-specific rules for Indonesia. The complexity comes from handling edge cases, implementing fallback logic, and ensuring accurate conversions. Domain knowledge of different calendar systems is required, making this a moderately complex task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Authentication and Authorization Middleware",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Authentication and Authorization Middleware task into subtasks covering: 1) JWT validation and payload processing, 2) Role-based access control implementation, 3) Error handling and security responses, and 4) Rate limiting and additional security features. Include security considerations for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing JWT authentication, role-based authorization, and security features. While it uses established patterns, security implementations require careful attention to detail and thorough testing. The complexity is moderate as it follows standard JWT practices but requires proper error handling and security considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "API Endpoints Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the API Endpoints Implementation task into subtasks covering: 1) Route setup and middleware configuration, 2) Update check endpoint implementation, 3) Event retrieval endpoints implementation, 4) Admin-only endpoints implementation, 5) Request validation and error handling, and 6) Response formatting and logging. Include detailed API specifications for each endpoint.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing multiple API endpoints with different access levels, complex request validation, and integration with multiple services (repository, authentication, calendar conversion). It has dependencies on several other tasks and requires implementing business rules from the PRD. The complexity is high due to these integrations and the need for comprehensive error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Localization and Translation Service",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Localization and Translation Service task into subtasks covering: 1) Core translation fetching and fallback logic, 2) Caching implementation for performance optimization, and 3) Language validation and text formatting utilities. Include internationalization best practices for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing localization logic for multiple languages with fallback mechanisms and caching. While it requires attention to internationalization details, the scope is relatively focused compared to other tasks. The complexity is moderate as it mainly involves data retrieval, caching, and formatting without complex business logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Scheduled Tasks and Scripts",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Scheduled Tasks and Scripts task into subtasks covering: 1) Google Calendar fetch script implementation, 2) Calendar mapping update script implementation, 3) Scheduling and cron job configuration, and 4) Error handling, notifications, and logging. Include command-line interface specifications for each script.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating scripts for scheduled data fetching and updates with proper error handling, notifications, and logging. It depends on other complex components (Google Calendar integration, calendar conversion). The complexity is moderate as it requires integrating existing functionality into scheduled scripts with robust error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Testing, Documentation, and Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the Testing, Documentation, and Deployment task into subtasks covering: 1) Unit testing framework setup and implementation, 2) Integration and performance testing, 3) API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger, 4) Project documentation in README and code comments, 5) Deployment configuration and scripts, and 6) CI/CD pipeline and database management. Include quality assurance criteria for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "This task encompasses multiple complex areas: comprehensive testing, documentation, deployment configuration, CI/CD setup, and database management. It depends on all other tasks being completed and requires expertise across multiple domains. The complexity is very high due to its broad scope, critical importance for project quality, and the need to ensure all components work together correctly."
